<h2>Turning 0 to 1, since 2001</h2>
<!--  
<p>Not to anyone's surprise, the dude you see in the left-hand side, is me. And it's my only photo with
    a bow tie, because it was the only time I ever wore one.
  </p>
-->
  <p>
    My name is Emre (pronounced Am-Ray) and I'm the founder and CEO of <a href="http://grou.ps">Grou.ps</a> which is one of the first, if not first, **private** social networking platforms. I've started it in late 2005.
  </p>

  <p>
    Grou.ps is today part of <a href="http://www.groups-inc.com">Grou.ps Inc</a>, a small profitable social networking company located in Silicon Valley and Istanbul.
  </p>

  <p>
    Grou.ps, at its peak as a free service, boasted 8 million monthly unique visitors (accordingly to Google Analytics) at a time when Facebook had 250 million monthly actives (2010 baby). Today it serves a smaller audience, though all from paying customers, including some marquee names worldwide.
  </p>

  <p>Since then, we've been working hard toying with new ideas and amassing a portfolio of intellectual property via  patent applications, while building up the business in new categories. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owen_Thomas_(writer)">Owen Thomas</a> <a href="http://readwrite.com/2015/08/27/grou-ps-gymgroups-social-fitness/">sums up</a> this period and our ongoing efforts as follows (edited for brevity):
  </p>


<div>
<blockquote>

<p> [...] It‚Äôs been a long time since ReadWrite caught up with Grou.ps founder and CEO Emre Sokullu [...] In 2008, his startup raised financing and launched its social groupware product, which at its peak had 8 million monthly unique users and 100 million monthly pageviews.
</p>
<p>
The Great Recession hit, and Sokullu turned Grou.ps into a paid service in an effort to generate revenues. That worked‚Äîthe company turned profitable in 2012‚Äîbut at the cost of torpedoing Grou.ps‚Äôs growth.
</p>
<p>
What Sokullu found was that about half of the remaining active communities on Grou.ps were fitness-related, like Ohio‚Äôs Columbus Running Club. [...] That inspired GymGroups. [...]
</p>
</blockquote>
</div>


<p>The Grou.ps story is still developing...</p>

  <p>
    Prior to Grou.ps I worked at hakia, an AI startup (before it was cool) which was my first step to a work visa in the US. hakia's semantic search technology was a predecessor to Google's -what we call today- Knowledge Graph. I joined hakia after a short internship stint at <a href="https://wordnet.princeton.edu/">Princeton University Wordnet Project</a> which was also my first time in the US.
  </p>

<p>
    During college (<a href="http://www.boun.edu.tr">Bogazici University</a>) from 2001 to 2005, I worked on several projects. <a href="https://github.com/esokullu/Dilmaca">Dilmaca</a>, now open source, was a web-scale machine translation software that did a decent job for a mechanical approach. Although the challenges were of academic level. Having realized Dilmaca wouldn't monetize anytime soon, I stopped  and moved on to something else, <a href="https://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=turkix">Turkix</a>, which paved the way to a small acquisition (at the age of 20!), and some financial relief.
  </p>

  <p>
Turkix was the first Linux distribution that supported all Turkic languages. Eventually Datron, then the leading laptop producer in Turkey, approached us to bundle it with their low-end models and replace Windows. As part of Turkix, I also led <a href="http://apache.org">Apache Software Foundation</a>'s Turkey operations, built a community of volunteers and hatched the first version of <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/tr/programs/httpd.html">Turkish httpd documentation</a>. Last but not least, <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/simplekde/">SimpleKDE</a>, which was a desktop environment that came with Turkix gained <a href="https://linux.slashdot.org/story/05/07/18/115238/kdes-future-plasma-simplekde">so much traction</a> that I got invitation from KDE headquarters to join their <a href="https://techbase.kde.org/Contribute/Quality_Team">KDE Quality</a> team; a proud moment for a 20-years-old kid.
  </p>


<p>Today, I write about open web, social, cryptocurrencies and AI on <a href="http://altplatform.org">AltPlatform</a>, a non-profit media organization and blog I've co-founded with my long-time friend <a href="https://richardmacmanus.com/">Richard MacManus</a>.</p>
