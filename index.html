  <p>Not to anyone's surprise, the dude you see in the left-hand side, is me. And it's my only photo with
    a bow tie, because it was the only time I ever wore one.
  </p>
  <p>
    My name is Emre (pronounced Am-Ray) and I'm the founder and CEO of <a href="http://grou.ps">Grou.ps</a> which is one of the first, if not first, **private** social networking platforms that I've started in late 2005.
  </p>

  <p>
    Grou.ps is today part of <a href="http://www.groups-inc.com">Grou.ps Inc</a>, a small profitable social networking company located in Silicon Valley and Istanbul.
  </p>

  <p>
    Grou.ps, at its peak as a free service, boasted 8 million monthly unique visitors (accordingly to Google Analytics) at a time when Facebook had 250 million monthly actives (2010 baby). Today it serves a smaller audience, though all from paying customers, including some marquee names worldwide.
  </p>

  <p>Since then, we've been working hard toying with new ideas and amassing a portfolio of intellectual property via  patent applications, while building up the business in new categories. Owen Thomas, of ReadWrite, <a href="http://readwrite.com/2015/08/27/grou-ps-gymgroups-social-fitness/">sums up</a> this period and our ongoing efforts as follows (edited for brevity):
  </p>


<div>
<blockquote>

<p> [...] It’s been a long time since ReadWrite caught up with Grou.ps founder and CEO Emre Sokullu [...] In 2008, his startup raised financing and launched its social groupware product, which at its peak had 8 million monthly unique users and 100 million monthly pageviews.
</p>
<p>
The Great Recession hit, and Sokullu turned Grou.ps into a paid service in an effort to generate revenues. That worked—the company turned profitable in 2012—but at the cost of torpedoing Grou.ps’s growth.
</p>
<p>
What Sokullu found was that about half of the remaining active communities on Grou.ps were fitness-related, like Ohio’s Columbus Running Club. [...] That inspired GymGroups. [...]
</p>

<p>The Grou.ps story is still developing...</p>

  <p>
    Prior to Grou.ps I worked at hakia, an AI startup (before it was cool) which was my first step to a work visa in the US. hakia's semantic search technology was a predecessor to Google's -what we call today- Knowledge Graph. I joined hakia after a short internship stint at <a href="https://wordnet.princeton.edu/">Princeton University Wordnet Project</a> which was also my first time in the US.
  </p>

<p>
    <strong>College Days</strong></br>
    During college (<a href="http://www.boun.edu.tr">Bogazici University</a>) from 2001 to 2005, I worked on several projects, but firstly and largely <a href="https://github.com/esokullu/Dilmaca">Dilmaca</a>, which was a personal hobby project of mine, that later on got support from Bogazici CMPE professors as well. Dilmaca was a web-scale machine translation software that did a decent job for a mechanical approach.  But I was in a position where I needed to earn money -now- and I realized Dilmaca wouldn't monetize anytime soon in local market conditions. So I stopped it abruptly and moved on to something else, <a href="https://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=turkix">Turkix</a>, that paved the way to a small acquisition (at the age of 20!), hence some financial relief. (PS:  I don't regret my time spent on Dilmaca, because it was then that I've started thinking about statistical methods, artificial intelligence and semantic graphs -- which later on helped me to get an internship at Princeton and a job at hakia)
  </p>

  <p>
In 2003-2004 Turkix became the first Linux distribution that supported all Turkic languages. Eventually Datron,  then leading laptop producer , approached me to bundle it to replace Windows in their low-end models. As part of Turkix, I also led Apache Software Foundation's Turkey operations and hatched the first version of Turkish httpd documentation. Last but not least, <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/simplekde/">SimpleKDE</a>, which was a desktop environment that came with Turkix gained so much traction that I got invitation from KDE headquarters to join their to work with the KDE Quality team -- a proud moment for a 20-years-old kid.

<p>
    So this was a quick summary of my professional life in reverse chronological order. As my track record show, my interest areas include social, social graph and AI. I love to build products and teams. I hold many pending or ... patent applications in the fields of including .. and ...

    In my spare time, I spend time with my beautiful daughter Defne and.
